Hi. Iâ€™m Mart Betz. I like  :camera_flash:  taking photos and  :computer:  messing about with computers (I also like :egg: breeding dodos,  :footprints:  walking barefoot, and :rainbow: juggling rainbows).

Nothing I could write here would be of any real interest to anyone, but you're welcome to [visit my website](https://martbetz.github.io) on Github pages or [reach out to me](https://discuss.pixls.us/u/martbetz) on the pixls.us forum.
