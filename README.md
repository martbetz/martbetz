Hi. Iâ€™m Mart Betz. I like  :camera_flash:  taking photos and  :computer:  messing about with computers (I also like :egg: breeding dodos,  :footprints:  walking barefoot, and :rainbow: juggling rainbows).

_I can assure you that the stories you hear about me â€” if nothing else â€” have been WATERED DOWN!_ ðŸ˜‰

Nothing I could write here would be of any real interest to anyone, but you may like to visit [my website](martbetz.github.io).
